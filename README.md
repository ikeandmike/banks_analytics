## Project Status:
Sept. 8, 2016: 
- Current version of parser and model are pushed. 
- Parser is complete, unless we decide to add more indicators to the model.
- The model outputs two reports, brief and detailed. Brief contains just the accuracy and probability vectors; detailed also includes the datasets and model predictions.
- Report figures are rounded to improve readability
