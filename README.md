Internal: Model that uses internal indicators to predict probability of revoking banking license
Macro: Modeling internal factors and probability of revoking banking license using macroeconomic data

## Project Status:
- Sept. 8, 2016: Current version of parser and model are pushed. Parser is complete, unless we decide to add more indicators to the model. The model outputs a probability vector, but I need to fix a bug in the detailed report.
